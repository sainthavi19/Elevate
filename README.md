# Testing 
- The Journal feature was tested by adding several entries and refreshing the page to see if the entries had been saved. It was also tested to see if users could enter long entries and if the entries were saved with the current date. You can test the Journal Page by adding multiple entries and seeing if they save with the current date. You can refresh the page to see if the entries are saved to the database. 
- Login Page can be tested by registering with a valid email you can try multiple different things like less than 6 characters for your password, not a valid email. Check if you can get registered. Then try logging in try different attempts with the password you put in and try out a different password and test out what happens. If it's not an email or not the password you put in it should give you an error. 
- Weather can be tested by pulling up the weather for Philadelphia on an app on your phone or a web browser and comparing if the data on the widget matches the data on your phone.
- The Calendar feature was tested by adding events at different times and days, allowing us to see if the inputs of events were outputting correctly. With this feature, we had to test the color buttons, by adding an event and choosing a different color every time. We also had to test the saving feature of the calendar, by refreshing the screen when all the events were added. This ensured us all of our events were saved as well as inputting events in different weeks and months. You can test the Calendar by adding several events on different days, at different times, and with different colors. You can refresh the screen and switch through different weeks to ensure that the events are saved.
- Budget Tracker has been tested by choosing options given on it such as income/expense and entering numerical values in the amount textbox to ultimately receive an output of the final budget and have a record of where income/expenses incurred. The output at the top of the tracker produces the correct output it is designated to give. Also tested were the delete buttons to ensure that history can be cleared for future use if desired.
- Water Intake was tested by entering numerical values in the text boxes provided and receiving the correct output value of how much more water was needed to reach the goal. Also includes a clear history button to start tracking water intake for future days.
